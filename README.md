 "Texture Array Wizard" is a personal tool I wrote in 2022 for a game development job while I was tasked with environment art. I have, and still continue to use this in professional and hobby projects. Make something great with this, please! 

 This tool is for Unity, please make sure you keep it within an "Editor" folder for your own sanity while using Unity Editor. 


 Texture Array Wizard is currently in 1.65, new versions coming soon with more features. 

 This texture array editor allows you to make and edit existing Texture2dArrays for Unity Engine. You can scroll through your textures in the GUI and replace existing textures within arrays!
